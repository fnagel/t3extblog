Like most other extensions, settings can be overwritten via TypoScript.

Have a look at :code:`/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript` and its includes (see `/Configuration/TypoScript/Includes/Settings`).


SPAM checks
-----------
.. _configuration-spam:

A comment has two additional visibility flags (besides TYPO3 default `hidden` and `deleted` flags):
*is approved* and *is spam*. Comments not approved or marked as SPAM are not displayed.

Admins configure if a comment should be approved by default or always needs manual approval.
In addition multiple basic SPAM checks flag every new comment as SPAM or not SPAM:

* Simple "I am human" checkbox (no real check for bots!)
* Honeypot fields
* Cookie support check
* User agent check
* Search for links in comment text

Each of these checks has a configurable spam point value. The sum of all spam points is compared to multiple
configurable threshold values in order to trigger specific actions:

* mark comment as spam but save it anyway
* block comment and allow user to try again
* redirect user to a configurable page


See TypoScript for full configuration:

* :code:`plugin.tx_t3extblog.settings.blogsystem.comments`
* :code:`plugin.tx_t3extblog.settings.blogSubscription`


.. important::

	Built in SPAM protection may be insufficient to protect your blog from serious attacks and does not prevent brute force attacks.


Speaking URLs
-------------
.. _configuration-speaking-url:

This extension include a predefined setup for the TYPO3 CMS core feature speaking URL,
see :code:`t3extblog/Configuration/Routes/Default.yaml` for details.

Default will render URLs for blog posts like this: `domain.com/page/article/2020/12/30/post-title/` but it's easy to
change this by either:

* Remove the `datePrefix` option completely, resulting in no date prefix in the URL:
   `domain.com/page/article/post-title/`
* Use any date format string with according prefix. For example with speaking month names:
   `datePrefix: 'Y/F/'` and `datePrefixRegex: '#^[^\/]*\/[^\/]*\/#'` resulting in URLs like
   `domain.com/page/article/2020/December/post-title/` (please note: you will need to adjust `requirements.post_title`
   to `^\d{4}\/\p{L}{3,10}\/[\p{Ll}\d\-\_]+$` in order to make this work; you might want to enable `datePrefixLowercase`
   too)

.. tip::
	Option `datePrefix` uses the `date()` method, see here for possible options:
   https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date
   https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php

Overwrite templates
-------------------
.. _configuration-overwrite-templates:

It's possible to copy only the needed files and have a fallback.

Use the constants or change the TS setup:

.. code-block:: typoscript

	plugin.tx_t3extblog {
        view {
			   # "Email/" is appended to the final template path when rendering emails
            templateRootPaths {
                0 = EXT:t3extblog/Resources/Private/Templates/
                10 = {$plugin.tx_t3extblog.view.templateRootPath}
                20 = EXT:my_theme/Resources/Private/T3extblog/Templates/
                30 = fileadmin/templates/ext/t3extblog/Templates/
            }
            partialRootPaths {
                0 = EXT:t3extblog/Resources/Private/Partials/
                10 = {$plugin.tx_t3extblog.view.partialRootPath}
                20 = EXT:my_theme/Resources/Private/T3extblog/Partials/
            }
            layoutRootPaths {
                0 = EXT:t3extblog/Resources/Private/Layouts/
                10 = {$plugin.tx_t3extblog.view.layoutRootPath}
                20 = EXT:my_theme/Resources/Private/T3extblog/Layouts/
            }
        }
	}
