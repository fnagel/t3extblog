Like most other extensions, settings can be overwritten via TypoScript.

Have a look at :code:`/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.txt`.


SPAM checks
-----------
.. _configuration-spam:

A comment has two additional visibility flags (besides TYPO3 default `hidden` and `deleted` flags):
*is approved* and *is spam*. Comments not approved or marked as SPAM are not displayed.

Admins configure if a comment should be approved by default or always needs manual approval.
In addition multiple basic SPAM checks flag every new comment as SPAM or not SPAM:

* Simple "I am human" checkbox (no real check for bots!)
* Honeypot fields
* Cookie support check
* User agent check

Each of these checks has a configurable spam point value. The sum of all spam points is compared to multiple
configurable threshold values in order to trigger specific actions:

* mark comment as spam but save it anyway
* block comment and allow user to try again
* redirect user to a configurable page


See TypoScript for full configuration:

* :code:`plugin.tx_t3extblog.settings.blogsystem.comments`
* :code:`plugin.tx_t3extblog.settings.blogSubscription`


.. important::

	Built in SPAM protection may be insufficient to protect your blog from serious attacks and does not prevent brute force attacks.


RealURL
-------
.. _configuration-realurl:

This extension include a predefined setup for RealURL auto configuration, see :code:`typo3conf/ext/t3extblog/Classes/Hooks/RealUrl.php` for details.

When using EXT:realurl or similar extension you will need to add additional staticTS template
`T3Extblog: additional RealUrl config (t3extblog)` (:code:`/Configuration/TypoScript/RealUrl/setup.txt`).

.. important::
	Add this static TS to the blogsystem plugin page only to preserve cache!

.. important::
	When not using the realurl autoconfig feature, you need to add the configuration by yourself!


Responsive image rendering
--------------------------
.. _configuration-rwd-images:

T3extblog is able to make use of TYPO3's RWD image rendering (sourceCollection feature).

This works by using a cObject ViewHelper within the templates which processes a TypoScript Lib:
:code:`lib.tx_t3extblog.responsiveImage` (defined in :code:`/Configuration/TypoScript/RealUrl/setup.txt`)

This feature is configured via TypoScript as described here:
https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TyposcriptReference/ContentObjects/Image/Index.html

By default, T3extblog makes uses of the tt_content image rendering configuration. It's possible to adjust the
rendering for t3extblog by modifying this TypoScript lib or by using a custom (i.e. Fluid) rendering.


Overwrite templates
-------------------
.. _configuration-overwrite-templates:

It's possible to copy only the needed files and have a fallback.

Use the constants or change the TS setup:

.. code-block:: typoscript

	plugin.tx_t3extblog {
        view {
			# "Email/" is appended to the final template path when rendering emails
            templateRootPaths {
                0 = {$plugin.tx_t3extblog.view.templateRootPath}
                1 = EXT:my_theme/Resources/Private/T3extblog/Templates/
                2 = fileadmin/templates/ext/t3extblog/Templates/
            }
            partialRootPaths {
                0 = {$plugin.tx_t3extblog.view.partialRootPath}
                1 = EXT:my_theme/Resources/Private/T3extblog/Layouts/
            }
            layoutRootPaths {
                0 = {$plugin.tx_t3extblog.view.layoutRootPath}
                1 = EXT:my_theme/Resources/Private/T3extblog/Partials/
            }
        }
	}
