	}


By default, hidden posts are only visible to authenticated backend users.



Multilanguage / Localization
----------------------------

**Requirements:**

Working multi language TYPO3 CMS installation.


**Needed steps:**

* Translate blogsystem plugin page

* Translate plugin elements

* Translate record sysfolder

* Start translating your posts and categories!


**Email localization**

All emails (subscription opt-in, new comment notify for admin and user) are single language only at the moment.

.. important::
	Please note: Added localization strings will work in frontend but not in backend context (e.g. when switch a comment visible from the BE).
	It's recommended to only use and change the default localization to keep all emails consistent.
	You may use FLUID if conditions within the email templates in order to localize your custom email templates.
