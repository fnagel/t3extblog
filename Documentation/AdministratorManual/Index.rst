RSS Feed
^^^^^^^^

RSS output, see chapter RSS.


Subscription Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. important::

	Use a separate page for this plugin!


This plugin manages blog post subscriptions. All email links will point to this page. We´ve already did some basic settings for this module in the installation process. But you should so some more configurations.

Configure the Subscription manager via TS (see :code:`t3extblog\Configuration\TypoScript\setup.txt`, look for "subscriptionManager"!


RSS Feed
--------

The RSS-Module need some special treatment, but no need to worry.

Just create a single page for the RSS-output, then

1. Choose the RSS plugin and insert it to that page (see above how to do this)
2. Create an extension template and include `T3Extblog: Rss setup (t3extblog)`

.. figure:: ../Images/AdministratorManual/rssincludestatic.png

	:alt: RSS include static

	RSS


When you open the page, the output should look like this:

.. figure:: ../Images/AdministratorManual/rssoutput.png
	:width: 609px
	:alt: RSS output

	RSS Output

Have a look at :code:`/Configuration/TypoScript/RSS/setup.txt`
You can override the values by using an extension template on the page where your have insert the Rss-modul.

When you want to use RealURL add the static template `T3Extblog: additional RealUrl config (t3extblog)` too.
When overriding the TS-values, add a :code:`config.tx_realurl_enable = 1` to your TS to get RealUrl running in the RSS-Feed.

.. important::
	Please note: Default RSS template depends on using RealUrl.
	You will need to escape links when using plain TYPO3 links.


Preview blog posts
------------------

The extension has a preview functionality. To activate it, just add :code:`tx_t3extblog.singlePid = 123`
to your page tsconfig (123 is the PID of the page where the blogsystem is included).

By default, hidden posts are only visible to authenticated backend users. This is done by TypoScript
(:code:`settings.previewHiddenRecords`), please see :code:`/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.txt`.



Multilanguage / Localization
----------------------------

**Requirements:**

Working multi language TYPO3 CMS installation.


**Needed steps:**

* Translate blogsystem plugin page

* Translate plugin elements

* Translate record sysfolder

* Start translating your posts and categories!


**Email localization**

All emails (subscription opt-in, new comment notify for admin and user) are single language only at the moment.

.. important::
	Please note: Added localization strings will work in frontend but not in backend. It's recommended to only use and
	change the default localization to keep all emails consistent.
