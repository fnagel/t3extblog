Upgrade from 1.1.x to 1.2.x

Changelog
"""""""""

.. important::
	Make sure to follow "How to upgrade" steps after updating!


**###MORE### marker**

This legacy functionality from t3blog was always an issue as it never worked as expected.
With introducing fields for preview image and text we finally can get rid of it!

The Install Tool Wizard provided will remove the marker where needed.
It will copy all text before the marker and paste it into our new *previewText* field.
When a *textpic* or *image* content element has been found before the marker,
the first of its images will be used as *previewImage* property.


**Templating**

Some post related templates and partials have been changed.
Please make sure to adapt these changes in your templates.

Some major changes:

* Now using namespaces for ViewHelpers, make sure to adjust your template references

* ViewHelper namespace in default templates has changed. Be careful!

* RenderPreview ViewHelper has been removed as no longer needed.
