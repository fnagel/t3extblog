Quick installation guide
------------------------

T3Extblog can be installed quickly by using the constant editor. You need to perform the following steps:

#. Install the extension via the Extension-Manager

#. Include static template:
	This can be done on your root-page or in an extension template places on a specific page.
	Minimum requirement: `T3Extblog: Default Setup (needed) (t3extblog)`.
	Do NOT include `T3Extblog: Rss setup (t3extblog)`! We will need this elsewhere.

#. Create a simple page structure for your blog
	At least we need a page for the blogsystem and a page for the Subscription Manager. We recommend to create an sysfolder for your blogposts to.
